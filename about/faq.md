# FAQs

Here are some frequently asked questions about Sodacore and the packages.

## What is Sodacore?

Sodacore is a modern, TypeScript-powered framework that utilises the latest web technologies to build complex applications with less code, where the Sodacore framework does most of the routing, autowiring and general boilerplate that you shouldn't need to care about.

Sodacore's main goal, is to make a framework that has the least resistance to get started with, and come out with a production level application at the end.

## Why should I use Sodacore?

- 🧊 Autowiring by default
- 🧩 Dependency injection
- 🧪 Plugin system
- 📦 Core maintained plugins, i.e. http, websocket, orm, prisma, etc.
- 📝 Built-in logging
- 📚 Built-in documentation
- 🖥️ CLI for tooling
