# Introduction

The sodacore framework is a collection of libraries and plugins for building out server-side applications in Node.JS (with TypeScript - we rely on TypeScript decorators).

## Why Sodacore?

Sodacore offers a way of building production grade applications in less time, and less boilerplate, by doing the heavy lifting for you.

The framework utilises built-in autowiring, dependency injection, and a plugin system that is powered by a simple controller system, where you write you focus on building your business logic, and the application (with some basic meta data provided by decorators) will do all of the routing and handling of events for you.

## Features

- 🧊 Autowiring by default
- 🧩 Dependency injection
- 🧪 Plugin system
- 📦 Core maintained plugins, i.e. http, websocket, database, etc.
- 📝 Built-in logging
- 📚 Built-in documentation
- 🖥️ CLI for tooling

## Our ethos

We believe that frameworks should be simple to use and easy to learn. We also believe that frameworks should be flexible, and allow you to build your application the way you want to build it.

We focus on the core features out of the box, providing you with a great developer experience, while also maintaining optimisations and performance, but don't worry, you can still access the underlying libraries and plugins to customise your application to your needs.
